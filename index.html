            The "Doomsday fish" is a nickname for the oarfish (Regalecus glesne), a deep-sea fish known for its long, ribbon-like body and rare surface appearances.
            It has been associated with earthquakes and disasters in folklore, particularly in Japan, where it is believed to be an omen of impending natural
            calamities. However, there is no scientific evidence linking oarfish sightings to seismic activity.
